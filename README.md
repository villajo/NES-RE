# NES-RE
Demake for Resident Evil NES

This is a personal project that I have to both show that I know how to code in Python and to be prototype of a demake I'd like to code on the NES. I 
decided to do this after I had bought and Everdrive N8 pro, then read some documents on how to code the NES. I was then left with the question, "What am I going to make?". Being that I don't like to fly by the seat of my pants 100% of the time, this project and others were created. I realize there already is a demake of Resident Evil on the NES, I'd like this to be more like the Gameboy Color/Playstation version by the time I'm done with it and less like the version that's already out there. There are a lot of elements to account for.. Lack of FMV, no sprite scaling, are at the top of my head.

Entire project is coded in Python3. I use Pygame for the rendering of graphics. All of the sprites are/were made by me as well as any of the artwork. Gamepad support is planned.

Current Status: 

Not much is implemented at the moment. This was started two weekends ago and has been in my spare time. I'm figuring out how to set boundaries at the moment and switch between scenes. I am loading json data from a file; this data includes X,Y boundary data on a hard axis (No diagonals yet), background picture data, the beginning of object data, and area name.
