# NES-RE
Demake for Resident Evil NES

This is a personal project that I have to both show that I know how to code in Python and to be prototype of a demake I'd like to code on the NES. I 
decided to do this after I had bought and Everdrive N8 pro, then read some documents on how to code the NES. I was then left with the question, "What am I going 
to make?". Being that I don't like to fly by the seat of my pants 100% of the time, this project and others were created. I realize there already is a demake 
of Resident Evil on the NES, I'd like this to be more like the Gameboy Color version by the time I'm done with it and less like an RPG. 

Entire project is coded in Python3 because I refuse to use 2.x. I use Pygame for the rendering of graphics. All of the sprites are/were made by me as well 
as any of the artwork.
